Create 'master' aura details and use this to create PDF for client aura input

A detailed list of all the body parts, associated aura colours and what they mean will be entered into the system.
A registered user (client), will then upload an aura photograph and choose the various body-part and associated colour. 
Based on client input, a PDF file will be generated with all the details culled from the master data, which will contains
positive inputs to user, remedial measures to be taken. System will also allow an experienced aura reader to leave a detailed
comment after reading the aura photograph.

The system can potentially be enhanced to automatically do facial and body recognition (hard), pick up the colour associated 
with each body part and generate the PDF file automatically, rather than the user choose body-part, associated aura colour, 
from a form.
